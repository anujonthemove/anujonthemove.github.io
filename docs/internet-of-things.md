### **‚úÖ Internet of Things (IoT) and Edge Computing**

Throughout my professional experience, I have undertaken various projects involving the setup and integration of miniature computing boards and the deployment of lightweight Computer Vision and Deep Learning models for efficient and real-time data processing. I have listed some of them below.

**Key Explorations:**

1. **Raspberry Pi + Arduino Uno + DHT11 Temperature Sensor Setup:**

    * Configured a Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno combination with a [**DHT11 temperature sensor**](https://components101.com/sensors/dht11-temperature-sensor) to collect temperature and humidity data.

    * Developed a Python wrapper using ctypes for the [**WiringPi library**](http://wiringpi.com/) to ensure seamless integration with the Python project.

2. **Raspberry Pi + [**Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2)**](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/neural-compute-stick.html) for Lightweight Computer Vision:**

    * Integrated the Intel Neural Compute Stick 2 (NCS2)* with a Raspberry Pi to enable efficient and accelerated execution of lightweight Computer Vision models.

    * Utilized the NCS2 for running Single Shot Detection (SSD) models, enabling real-time object detection capabilities.

        _*Please note that Intel has discontinued this product line._

3. **Setting up [**NVIDIA Jetson NX**](https://www.nvidia.com/en-in/autonomous-machines/embedded-systems/jetson-xavier-nx/) for Deep Learning Inference:**

    * Learned to set up the Jetson board.

    * Explored and implemented various Deep Learning models for tasks like object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation on Jetson.

4. **[**MLPerf**](https://mlcommons.org/en/) Benchmarking on Jetson:**

    * Configured MLPerf, a widely used benchmark suite for Deep Learning performance, on the Jetson platform.

    * Benchmarked custom Deep Learning models on Jetson to evaluate their efficiency and power consumption as part of hardware benchmarking.

These projects have provided invaluable hands-on experience in building and optimizing IoT and Edge Computing systems, empowering me with the knowledge and skills to design innovative solutions for real-world applications.
